INFO:root:The text discusses leveraging natural language feedback in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning to improve the generalization performance of RL agents. It highlights the potential of providing agents with richer feedback similar to how humans learn from diverse feedback sources, including natural language. By incorporating language feedback in training, the study shows enhancements in agents' generalization capabilities, even when the feedback is not available during inference. The approach involves generating language feedback automatically and modifying existing RL algorithms to accommodate this feedback. This research aims to bridge the performance gap between AI systems and human learning abilities by enhancing agents' learning with human-like feedback signals expressed in natural language. The text discusses a method for offline reinforcement learning where the decision-making process is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The Decision Transformer (DT) conditions action generation on future desired returns instead of past rewards. This approach uses returns-to-go and a GPT architecture for autoregressive generation of actions. The learning objective of the DT is to minimize the next-action prediction loss given the history and current state. The text also mentions related work in the field of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) which focuses on dynamically adapting machine learning models. This text discusses the use of feedback in training decision-making models, specifically in the context of language-conditioned offline reinforcement learning (RL). It outlines how responses generated by base models are evaluated by humans, and this feedback is used to train reward models. The Feedback Decision Transformer (FDT) method is proposed to leverage language feedback in the training process. The text compares this approach to other studies that utilize feedback in prompts for various language and AI tasks, emphasizing the unique application of feedback in the context of RL. The FDT architecture is described as building upon the Decision Transformer algorithm, which approaches RL as a sequence modeling problem. The text emphasizes the importance of incorporating feedback to refine model outputs and align them with user preferences. The text discusses the Feedback Decision Transformer (FDT) architecture, which extends the Text Decision Transformer (TDT) by allowing action generation to be conditioned on various inputs such as language goal instructions, real-time goals (RTG), and language feedback. The model utilizes the Decision Transformer based on GPT2 and an encoder for image observations. It incorporates sentence-level embeddings for mission and language feedback strings generated using predefined rules and templates. The feedback types include 'Rule Feedback' and 'Task Feedback,' providing information on the consequences of the agent's actions. The model aims to generate low-level language feedback automatically and does not predict observations, returns-to-go, or mission feedback. The implementation uses absolute positional embeddings and aims to enhance language feedback generation in the environment. The text discusses the concept of Rule Feedback as a form of corrective feedback with detailed explanations for failures in a simulator environment. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding heuristics and instruction language in feedback. The study aims to improve an agent's ability to generalize to new environments and tasks with language feedback and examines how it can complement or replace numerical feedback. The experiments are conducted using BabyAI, a suite of gridworld environments for training agents on goal-oriented tasks specified in language. The levels in BabyAI vary in difficulty and provide challenges with sparse rewards. The text describes a study conducted in a sparse-reward setting where eight levels, consisting of single rooms and mazes, were selected for offline training data generation using a random policy. Trajectories were created for each level, comprising mission strings, partial image observations, discrete actions, scalar rewards, and feedback strings for each timestep, regardless of episode success. Training datasets did not contain optimal trajectories, distinguishing the study from previous approaches. Performance was measured using high-level language goal instructions paired with goal objects, with goal-condition success rate serving as the evaluation metric. Additionally, a zero-shot compositional generalization evaluation protocol was developed, inspired by previous work on grounded language learning, to test the agent's ability to generalize to novel combinations of context dimension values during training. The text discusses a study where the goal object's color and type dimensions are systematically manipulated during testing. Different combinations of values are tested, including unseen combinations of coordinates. The study evaluates the agent's ability to generalize to values beyond the training data range. Various scenarios are tested, comparing models that condition on different factors such as language feedback, mission, and RTG. Generalization performance is analyzed in in-distribution and out-of-distribution contexts, with results presented for different model variants. The study also explores the impact of providing feedback during training and inference on generalization performance. The training procedure and detailed results are provided in the appendices. The text discusses experimental results showing that conditioning action generation on language feedback in the BabyAI setting can improve policy learning compared to conditioning solely on reward or one-off language instructions. Language feedback can be more beneficial for certain tasks and environments, and combining different types of feedback may impact performance differently. For example, combining language feedback with task feedback improves performance on single-room levels, while combining mission with rule feedback boosts performance on levels with longer horizons. Replacing reward or mission with feedback can also improve out-of-distribution performance in certain scenarios. Overall, the results suggest that language feedback can provide higher-level information for improved generalization in learning tasks. The text explores the use of automatically generated language feedback to train agents in sparse-reward environments with language-specified goals. The study shows that conditioning on such feedback, in addition to goal instructions or desired return, can lead to significant improvements in generalization to unseen environments. The feedback is considered as a useful signal especially in environments that require agents to interpolate or extrapolate to new contexts. The text also discusses the potential of applying this approach to other reinforcement learning algorithms and environments beyond 2D gridworlds. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of exploring multi-modal representations that are grounded and situated for future work. The text includes references to various academic papers that discuss topics such as feedback in education, origins of inquiry in early childhood, explanations in artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning in gaming, and training language models with human feedback. These papers cover a range of subjects related to learning, cognition, and artificial intelligence research. The text provides citations of various research papers focusing on topics such as reinforcement learning, language models, embodied reasoning through planning, task planning using scene graphs, and more. These papers discuss techniques and approaches to improve machine learning models by incorporating human feedback, external knowledge, prompt editing, self-debugging, language-to-code generation verification, and interaction with textual data. The text provides a list of research papers related to various topics such as attention mechanisms, sentence embeddings, world models, reinforcement learning, and grounded language learning. The papers cover a range of subjects from mastering diverse domains through world models to investigating the role of language in action learning in interactive environments. Each paper addresses different aspects of machine learning and natural language processing. The text discusses various research papers related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. It touches upon topics such as spatial-temporal reasoning, zero-shot generalization in deep reinforcement learning, neural network generalization, scaling reinforcement learning from human feedback with AI feedback, and datasets like BabyAI levels. Furthermore, it provides information on feedback generation methods and templates used in the studies. The text discusses rule feedback templates for different actions in a task environment, providing examples of conditions that could prevent successful completion of actions. It also outlines model architecture and training parameters for a GPT2-based model used for training in the task environment. Early stopping based on goal-condition success is mentioned, along with the use of batches of 64 samples and random starting points for sub-episode sampling. The text discusses various training hyperparameters and optimization techniques for a deep learning model, as well as the performance results based on different environment and level types. It includes details such as the number of layers, attention heads, hidden dimension, dropout rate, non-linearity, image encoder details, convolution parameters, optimization parameters like optimizer type and learning rate, and other settings like maximum gradient norm, epochs, batch size, and early stopping criteria. The results show the success rates of different model variants in terms of generalization and performance in different environments and tasks compared to baseline models. The text discusses various performance metrics related to feedback and success rates in different scenarios and conditions, particularly focusing on generalization in different tasks and variations. The data includes comparisons against baseline models and highlights the impact of return and feedback on success rates in different settings. The text presents data on the generalization performance of different variants compared to a baseline in various tasks and feedback conditions. The performance is measured in terms of success rate percentage changes for both in-distribution (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization scenarios. The results show how different feedback types and task conditions impact generalization performance across different mission types. The text discusses the impact of feedback on out-of-distribution generalization performance in a proposed model. It compares different variants conditioned on return and/or feedback with baselines such as vanilla DT and vanilla TDT. The results show changes in performance across different levels and types of out-of-distribution scenarios. Feedback is evaluated against mission-only and RTG-only baselines, showing varying levels of improvement or decline in performance. The study also examines the effect of different types of feedback, including all feedback, rule feedback, and task feedback, on generalization performance in different scenarios. The text provides a comparison of performance levels between baseline and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios for different tasks such as GoToObj, GoToLocal, PutNextLocal, PickupLoc, Pickup, PutNext, Synth, and SynthLoc. It shows the delta change in performance and percentage differences at inference for each task. Additionally, it includes a table comparing the use of Task Feedback in addition to mission/RTG, showing changes in performance when using feedback at inference. The data highlights variations in performance levels across different tasks and feedback scenarios.
